The core solution involves delaying the application of Tailwind classes until after the client-side hydration process. For Next.js, leveraging `useEffect` hook (or similar in other frameworks) allows us to apply classes only after the component mounts. This ensures that Tailwind has already processed the classes before rendering the actual styles.

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrates the problem)
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">This should be blue, but might not be.</div>
);
export default MyComponent;

// bugSolution.js (Demonstrates the solution)
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // You may need to add any additional logic to ensure the Tailwind CSS has been properly initialized before applying styles if required. 
  }, []);
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">This should be blue, and it is.</div>
  );
};
export default MyComponent;
```
