This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when you try to apply Tailwind directives (like `className` or `class`) to an element that's rendered *before* Tailwind's post-processing step occurs. This frequently happens in situations where server-side rendering (SSR) is involved or when using dynamic component generation. Tailwind relies on transforming your CSS-in-JS classes, and if that transformation is missed, you'll end up with classes that aren't rendered correctly, resulting in unexpected styles or missing styles altogether.
